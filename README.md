<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

A project about tasty Venezuelan food recipes that we have preserved as cultural heritage wherever we go in the world. I reckon everyone in the world should be able to try different foods and explore the cuisine of different regions, especially Venezuelan one.

Here's why:
- It brings us closer together
- It allow us to learn about other cultures 
- It makes us realize that after al we're more similar than different

Of course, this is just my perspective, but at least I'm giving it a try here in Github hey. Let's see if I can make this intention a reality!
